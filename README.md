## Image Resizer
Script that resize all the images in an input folder by a scale factor and save the resized image into an output folder.
Input folder can't be the output folder, since it will overwrite the original file in the input folder.

usage: `py image_resizer.py <input folder> <output folder> <scale factor>`

install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python`
